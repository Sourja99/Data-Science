4)What's a fiscal quarter? A fiscal quarter is a consecutive, three-month period within a business's fiscal year (or one-fourth of a year). Publicly-traded companies use fiscal quarters to release reports at the end of each quarter (called 10-Q reports) with financial statements that outline information for the period.

5)The first quarter is Q1, the second quarter is Q2, the third quarter is Q3, the third quarter is Q4. What are the dates of Fiscal Quarters in the United States? Q1 is January, February, and March, Q2 is April, May, and June, Q3 is July, August, and September, and Q4 is October, November, and December.

6)First quarter, Q1: 1 January – 31 March (90 days or 91 days in leap years) Second quarter, Q2: 1 April – 30 June (91 days) Third quarter, Q3: 1 July – 30 September (92 days) Fourth quarter, Q4: 1 October – 31 December (92 days)

6.6) Compute correlation in R
R functions
Correlation coefficient can be computed using the functions cor() or cor.test():


cor() computes the correlation coefficient
cor.test() test for association/correlation between paired samples. It returns both the correlation coefficient and the significance level(or p-value) of the correlation .


The simplified formats are:

cor(x, y, method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))
cor.test(x, y, method=c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))
